#interesting findings:
#we can see that the number of malware and hacking has increased what the book has provides and what verizon
#provides us. But why is this? I personally think that the technology has created a bigger infrastructure which has
#now created another source for income for criminal; regadless there is still a huge number of physical theft and
#that will slowly change to more hacking and malware issues since we can now steal information and sell without
#risking to show our own identity.

#interesting findings on external variety
#It is not so long ago that we had attacks on our countries these came in physcial form but we see slowly change in
#this also. We see that groups such as 'Unaffiliated, Terrorist, Organized crime, Nation???state, Former employee,
#Force majeure' increased in external attacks and while these were at 0% during the older data set!

print(verisplot(vcdb_orginal, "action.physical.variety"))

print(verisplot2(vcdb_verizon, "action.physical.variety"))

#interesting findings on physical variety
#Theft is still number one but the following methods have increased from 0%: 'Tampering, Surveillance, Skimmer,
#Disabled controls, Bypassed controls, Assault' why tho? is the Internet of Thing creating a bigger problom that we
#can handle? I believe that the information that is provided by Verizon to us is showing prove that the Internet of
#Thing is increasing our risk to attacks while it was only physical we can see many other forms growing.

#interesting findings on physical
#I dont think that anything has changed in the hacking society it is still an elite group which has his own way of #surviving.

#interesting findings on data variety
#More data means? More risk of loss the lesser we have out there the better we can see that their is a huge portion
#unknown 20%. The rest is almost identical thus I can conclude that the data has not much changed but we got bigger
#and new application might have created different kind of data which is not logged yet such as Tor
